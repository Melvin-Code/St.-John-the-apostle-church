      "A small group of residents from  Hialeah-Miami Springs gathered  together in the year of 1941 to organize their mission to pray and hopefully build a Catholic Church  and school in this area. The money the they profited from enabled  the Mission to lease the Palm Theater for Sunday morning mass. In February of 1942, the mass was celebrated for the first time in the Palm Theater at 9:30 A.M. and each and every Sunday thereafter. The Most Reverend Bishop Joseph P. Hurley appointed Father Lawrence J.Flynn to organize the new parish of St. John the Apostle in November of 1945.",
      "As St. John's parish started to to grow and progress, a tract of ten acres on East Fourth Avenue was finally  purchased to build a church and school. Ground breaking ceremonies were held in February of 1949 for the school, chapel-auditorium, rectory and convent. The convent was finished first and it was announced that we were going to have the Sisters of Mercy from Philadelphia as teachers. In July of 1949, mass was offered for the first time in the new Church. The parish grew rapidly after that and many ministries and clubs were formed.",
      "On January 22, 1950, the Most Reverend      Thomas J. McDonough Auxiliary Bishop of St. Augustine celebrated a Pontifical Mass for the blessing and dedication of the School with Chapel-Auditorium, Rectory and Convent. The Chapel-Auditorium provided seating for 500 people and was connected directly with the school.",
      "On February 8, 1952 our beloved founder    was called to his heavenly reward and Fr. James Nelan succeeded as Administrator. In October of 1952, Fr. Peter Reilly was appointed Pastor of St. John's and served until 1959.",
      'In March of 1960 Fr. James Connaughton     was appointed Pastor. He introduced the "Tithing Program" and through his devoted efforts and spiritual prayers led us to our goal "A New Church." Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in February of 1962 for the new church which has a seating capacity for 1200 people. St. John the Apostle was the First church to have its Baptistery outside of the church itself.',
      'In 1969 -Fr. Thomas J. Rynne and Irish      priest was appointed fourth pastor.',
      'In 1982 - Fr. Paul Vuturo was appointed    the fifth pastor and began a "Parish Renewal." He built the  impressive marble presbytery and baptismal font.',
      'In 1986, Fr. George Gacia, a cuban      priest was appointed the sixth pastor. Under his leadership new  spiritual programs were implemented.',
      'On June 16, 1992, Archbishop Edward      McCarthy appointed Fr. Emilio Martin, a priest from spain, seventh pastor of St. John. He had served as Associate Pastor of the parish in 1964 and again in 1968.',
      'Fr. Martin retired in 2010 and Msgr.      Oscar Castaneda was named Pastor. He was succeeded in August 2013 by our current Pastor Fr. Hector A. Perez. The tradition of previous pastors      continues, emphasizing pastoral programs and ministries allows members to participate in the life of the Church. This is what makes the parish of St. John the Apostle a joyful Christian community.'
